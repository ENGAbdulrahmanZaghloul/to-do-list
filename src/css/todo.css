/*
ðŸŽ‰ New Project with React.js ! Todo App ðŸš€ Excited to share my new project built using React.js ! This project was a great opportunity to dive deeper into Hooks. ðŸ’¡ Project Highlights: A simple project where I explored core Hooks such as: âœ… useState for state management. âœ… useEffect for handling side effects and updates. âœ… useContext for managing shared data across components easily. I also learned how to store and retrieve data using LocalStorage,
improving the user experience significantly. ðŸ“Œ Challenges: I faced multiple challenges during development,
but using Hooks made solving these issues much more efficient and organized. âœ¨ This experience has helped me better understand the power of React.js and how to build dynamic,
user-friendly applications. Looking forward to working on more advanced projects in the future ! #ReactJS #WebDevelopment #Frontend #Hooks #useState #useEffect #useContext #LocalStorage #LearningByDoing
